## Landfire Existing Vegetation Type (EVT)

The [Existing Vegetation Type
(EVT)]((http://www.landfire.gov/NationalProductDescriptions21.pph)
layer represents the species composition currently present at a given
site. Vegetation map units are primarily derived from NatureServe's
Ecological Systems classification, which is a nationally consistent
set of mid-scale ecological units. Additional units are derived from
NLCD, National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Alliances,
and LANDFIRE specific types.
